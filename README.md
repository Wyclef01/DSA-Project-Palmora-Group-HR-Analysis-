# DSA Project Palmora Group HR Analysis

## Project Description
The Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company based in Nigeria, is embroiled in issues bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions. Unfortunately, the media recently published the news with the headline “Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy”. This doesn’t look good for the owners of the business, based on their ambition to scale the business to other regions and even overseas. Cases like this can only spiral downwards, revealing other issues like the gender pay gap, amongst other possible issues.
The CEO of Palmoria, Mr Ayodeji Chukwuma, is keen to address these issues before they get out of hand. 
As an HR Analytics expert I'm to analyse the company’s HR data and come up with recommendations for management’s attention.

## Analysis task
1. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and departments
2. Show insights on ratings based on gender
3. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of management
4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of $90,000

   ● Does Palmoria meet this requirement?

   ● Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example:

   ● How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000, etc.?

   ● Also visualize this by region

5. Mr Gamma thought to himself that since I'm already working on the employee data, I could help out with allocating the annual bonus pay to employees based on the performance rating. He handed me another data set that contains rules for making bonus payments and asked me to:
   
    ● Calculate the amount to be paid as a bonus to individual employees
  
    ● Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of bonus)
  
    ● Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide

## Project Insight

### Gender Distribution

The company's gender distribution is balanced, with males at 49.52% and Females at 46.30% while the undisclosed is 4.18%, leaving the difference by only 3.22%. Regional and Departmental distribution vary, with Kaduna showing the largest gender gap, while Legal department has more male(49) than female(34).

### Performance Rating

Most employee were rated 'Good' or 'Average', with few rated 'Poor' and 'Very poor'


### Salary Structure

Males generally earn more than females across most regions and departments, with notable gaps in Kaduna's Marketing and Abuja's Accounts departments. However, the total pay difference between the genders is minimal, indicating that Palmoria's gender pay gap as suggested by the media may be less significant than perceived.

### Salary Regulation

Palmoria's salaries fall below the regulatory minimum of N90,000, with an average of N78,000 and a minimum of N28,130. Currently, 732 employees earn below the minimum salary requirement.

### Bonus Distribution

A total of N26 million was distributed in bonuses monthly, with females receiving higher bonus amounts across all regions.

## Recommendations

Ensure Minimum Salary Compliance: Review salary for employees earning below the minimum salary threshold as stipulated by the regulation and ensure there is a regular review of the salary band to comply with future regulations.

Promote Gender Inclusivity: Enhance programs and policies that support gender balance and inclusivity in the workplace.

Address Unspecified Data: Investigate and address reasons behind the 4.18% of unspecified gender information to encourage transparency.

There should be an equilibrium between the salary for male and female employees.

Analyse Pay Equity: Conduct regular pay audits to ensure fair compensation across genders, regions and departments.

Introduction of a performance incentive with an end goal of pay rise and promotion to encourage the employees performance.

## Conclusion
After my analysis, Palmoria Group are not gender bais as stated by the media.
