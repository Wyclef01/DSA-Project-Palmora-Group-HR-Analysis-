# DSA Project Palmora Group HR Analysis

## Project Description
The Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company based in Nigeria, is embroiled in issues bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions. Unfortunately, the media recently published the news with the headline “Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy”. This doesn’t look good for the owners of the business, based on their ambition to scale the business to other regions and even overseas. Cases like this can only spiral downwards, revealing other issues like the gender pay gap, amongst other possible issues.
The CEO of Palmoria, Mr Ayodeji Chukwuma, is keen to address these issues before they get out of hand. 
As an HR Analytics expert I'm to analyse the company’s HR data and come up with recommendations for management’s attention.

## Analysis task
1. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and departments
2. Show insights on ratings based on gender
3. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of management
4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of $90,000

   ● Does Palmoria meet this requirement?

   ● Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example:

   ● How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000, etc.?

   ● Also visualize this by region

5. Mr Gamma thought to himself that since I'm already working on the employee data, I could help out with allocating the annual bonus pay to employees based on the performance rating. He handed me another data set that contains rules for making bonus payments and asked me to:
   
    ● Calculate the amount to be paid as a bonus to individual employees
  
    ● Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of bonus)
  
    ● Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide
